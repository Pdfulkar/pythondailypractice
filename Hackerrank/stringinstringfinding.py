# In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.
#
# NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line of input contains the original string. The next line contains the substring.
#
# Constraints
#
#
# Each character in the string is an ascii character.
#
# Output Format
#
# Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.
#
# Sample Input
#
# ABCDCDC
# CDC
# Sample Output
#
# 2
# Concept
#
# Some string processing examples, such as these, might be useful.
# There are a couple of new concepts:
# In Python, the length of a string is found by the function len(s), where  is the string.
# To traverse through the length of a string, use a for loop:
#
# for i in range(0, len(s)):
#     print (s[i])
# A range function is used to loop over some length:
#
# range (0, 5)
# Here, the range loops over  to .  is excluded.
